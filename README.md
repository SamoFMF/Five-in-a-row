AI class project.

You can play against the computer by running `pet_v_vrsto.py`, but GUI is very basic and does not include almost any features, because it was not the objective of the project. To change computers AI etc., you need to edit `self.igralec_2` in `pet_v_vrsto.py`'s function `zacni_igro`.
